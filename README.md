# Threat Intelligence Feed Aggregator üõ°Ô∏è

A Python-based tool to automatically download, process, and store threat intelligence data from various open-source feeds. This project creates a local, queryable database of malicious indicators, such as IPs and domains, for security analysis and research.

This tool is a foundational element for many defensive security operations, allowing for quick checks against known malicious entities.
